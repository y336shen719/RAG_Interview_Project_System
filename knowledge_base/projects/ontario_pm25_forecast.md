Executive Report: Next-Day PM2.5 Forecasting for Proactive School
Decision-Making in Ontario Policy Analytics Division 1 Context This
analysis was conducted for the Ontario Ministry of Education,
specifically the Policy Analytics and Student Well-Being Division. The
division is responsible for issuing guidance to school boards during
environmental health events, including extreme air-quality episodes. The
Director overseeing this work requires an assessment of whether
predictive analytics can materially improve institutional preparedness,
reduce operational disruption, and protect vulnerable student
populations. Over the past several decades, regulatory advances and
improved monitoring have substantially reduced air pollution in many
high-income countries (World Health Organization 2021). However, since
approximately 2015, climate-driven factors---most notably increasingly
severe and frequent wildfires---have emerged as major drivers of extreme
particulate exposure (Reid et al. 2016). In Canada, wildfire smoke has
repeatedly affected major population centres, including the Greater
Toronto Area and Ottawa--Gatineau. Children are particularly vulnerable
to particulate exposure due to developing respiratory systems and higher
inhalation rates (Brook et al. 2010). Current school-level responses are
largely reactive. Same-day advisories leave limited time for
transportation planning, ventilation adjustments, communication with
families, and scheduling changes. The central question addressed in this
report is whether next-day PM2.5 concentrations can be forecasted with
suﬀicient reliability to support proactive and equitable
decision-making. 2 Executive Summary Using 2020--2024 regional PM2.5,
weather, and traﬀic data, we evaluated next-day forecasting models under
strict chronological validation. A region-wise LASSO baseline achieved
mean out- of-sample 𝑅2 ≈0.25. A sequence-based LSTM improved performance
to 𝑅2 = 0.356, MAE = 1.96 µg/m³, and RMSE = 2.71 µg/m³. This represents
a 12--19% reduction in error relative to persistence baselines. The
forecasting improvement is statistically credible and operationally
meaningful. Most impor- tantly, gains are strongest during elevated
pollution periods, which are precisely when advance notice is most
valuable. 1 3 Data 3.1 Data Sources and Integration This study
constructs a region-level panel dataset for Ontario to support next-day
(24-hour mean) PM2.5 forecasting. All data are publicly available and
obtained from oﬀicial provincial and federal sources. Hourly PM2.5
measurements were obtained from Air Quality Ontario (Ontario Ministry of
the Environment, Conservation and Parks). Observations span January 1,
2020 to December 31, 2024. Meteorological data were retrieved from
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) monitoring stations and
include daily measures of temperature, wind speed and direction, gust
characteristics, and precipitation. Weather and air-quality datasets
were aligned temporally at the daily level and spatially aggregated to
Ontario administrative regions using oﬀicial station metadata and a
Station ID--to--region lookup table. The resulting dataset contains one
observation per region-day, yielding 51,830 region-day observations. All
region-day PM2.5 observations were retained during integration. If
meteorological data were unavailable for a given region-day, weather
variables were recorded as missing rather than dropping the observation
to avoid systematically excluding pollution events. 3.2 Weather Data
Cleaning and Quality Control The Ontario daily weather dataset
(2020--2025) was cleaned into an analysis-ready station--day table.
Cleaning procedures included: 1. Standardization of column names to
lowercase snake_case. 2. Resolution of duplicate column names (retaining
the final occurrence). 3. Normalization of identifiers (e.g., trimming
station names; casting climate IDs to string for- mat). 4. Parsing and
reconstructing date components from timestamp fields. 5. Coercion of
meteorological variables to numeric types, with invalid entries set to
missing. 6. Conversion of gust direction from tens-of-degrees to
degrees, normalized to \[0, 360). 7. Engineering of quality indicators
from metadata flags. Physical plausibility bounds were applied to detect
outliers, which were set to missing and flagged via dedicated indicator
variables. Precipitation trace values were set to 0.0 while retaining
trace indicators. Records were deduplicated by (station_id, date),
enforcing one row per station per day. A station-level missingness
summary was constructed to evaluate completeness and support station
screening. 2 3.3 PM2.5 Processing Hourly PM2.5 observations were
aggregated to daily averages at the station level. Days with entirely
missing hourly readings were recorded as missing rather than imputed.
Station-level daily averages were then aggregated to region-level daily
means. This aggregation ensures consistency in geographic granularity
between meteorological and pollu- tion data while preserving regional
heterogeneity. 3.4 Exploratory Data Analysis Daily regional PM2.5
concentrations exhibit strong right-skewness (skewness ￿13.85), with
rare ex- treme events exceeding 400 µg/m³. The mean is 6.63 µg/m³ and
the median 5.43 µg/m³, indicating that exposure risk is driven by
episodic spikes rather than typical conditions. Temporal diagnostics
reveal strong persistence: lag-1 autocorrelation is approximately 0.72,
and current PM2.5 is moderately correlated with next-day PM2.5 (r
￿0.57). An Augmented Dickey-- Fuller test rejects the unit-root
hypothesis (p \< 0.001), suggesting stationarity in deviations around a
mean level. Meteorological associations are directionally consistent
with atmospheric theory: wind speed and precipitation are negatively
associated with PM2.5, while temperature shows a positive associa- tion.
These empirical patterns justify inclusion of lagged, rolling, and
meteorological predictors in forecasting models. 3.5 Feature Engineering
and Leakage Control All predictors were constructed using strictly
historical information within each region to prevent data leakage.
Features include: • Lagged PM2.5 values • Rolling means and volatility
measures • Lagged and aggregated meteorological variables • Cyclical
seasonal encodings (sine/cosine transformations) Observations with
incomplete historical windows were removed to preserve temporal
integrity. Train--test splits were performed chronologically. 4 Model
4.1 LASSO Baseline A region-wise LASSO regression was implemented as a
transparent linear baseline. Separate models were estimated for each
region to account for spatial heterogeneity. 3 Predictors were
standardized within a scikit-learn pipeline to ensure scaling parameters
were learned exclusively from the training data. A strict chronological
split (80% train / 20% test) was applied within each region. The
regularization parameter was selected via five-fold cross-validation on
the training set. The L1 penalty induces sparsity, enabling automatic
feature selection and improving interpretability. Evaluation metrics
computed on the held-out test set include: • Mean Absolute Error (MAE) •
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) • 𝑅2 • Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE) • Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) • Pearson correlation 4.2 LSTM Sequence
Model To capture nonlinear dynamics and temporal dependence, we
implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using fixed-length
14-day historical windows. The dataset contains sequences of shape 𝑁× 14
× 18. Samples were time-split (80% train / 20% test) using end_date to
prevent leakage. Within the training block, the final 10% was reserved
for validation and early stopping. Model architecture: - 2-layer LSTM
encoder (hidden size = 128) - Dropout = 0.15 - MLP regression head
Training: - AdamW optimizer (lr = 1e-3, weight_decay = 1e-4) - Batch
size = 256 - Max epochs = 50 - Gradient clipping = 1.0 - Early stopping
(patience = 8) - Huber (SmoothL1) loss The target was log-transformed
during training and inverted at inference. All metrics are reported in
original µg/m³ scale. Two baseline comparators were evaluated on the
same test split: 1. Persistence (tomorrow = last observed value) 2.
Rolling mean (tomorrow = mean over window) 5 Results 5.1 LASSO
Performance Across 26 regions, the LASSO baseline achieved: • Mean test
𝑅2 = 0.25 (median ￿0.22) • Mean RMSE = 2.9 µg/m³ • Mean MAE = 2.2 µg/m³
• Mean Pearson 𝑟= 0.55 4 Performance heterogeneity was substantial, with
some regions achieving 𝑅2 \> 0.45 and others below 0.10, reflecting
regional differences in pollution dynamics. The model selected
approximately 30--40 predictors per region on average. Frequently
retained variables included lagged PM2.5, wind metrics, precipitation,
and seasonal encodings. While inter- pretable, the linear specification
explains only a modest portion of future variability. 5.2 LSTM
Performance The LSTM substantially outperformed all baselines: Model MAE
RMSE 𝑅2 Pearson 𝑟 LSTM 1.96 2.71 0.356 0.598 Persistence 2.24 --- 0.137
--- Window Mean 2.42 --- 0.090 --- This corresponds to: - \~12--13% MAE
reduction vs persistence - \~19% MAE reduction vs rolling mean MAPE
values (\~50%) are inflated due to small denominators on low-pollution
days; MAE, RMSE, and 𝑅2 provide more stable evaluation. Permutation
importance indicates dominant reliance on recent PM2.5 history, with
meaning- ful secondary contributions from meteorological variables
(temperature, precipitation, gust speed/direction) and seasonal proxies.
Extending the input window beyond 7 days yielded marginal gains,
suggesting predictive informa- tion is concentrated in recent history.
5.3 Comparative Interpretation The LASSO baseline demonstrates that
linear and seasonal structure explains a meaningful share of PM2.5
dynamics. However, the LSTM's consistent improvement over persistence
establishes that nonlinear temporal modeling adds statistically and
operationally significant predictive value. From a decision-theoretic
perspective, the improvement over persistence justifies deployment in
settings where next-day preparedness decisions carry asymmetric costs,
particularly during high- pollution events. 6 Regional Heterogeneity,
Equity, and Seasonal Strategy Substantial heterogeneity exists across
Ontario regions. Southern and industrialized regions exhibit
persistently higher mean PM2.5 concentrations and greater variability.
These regions function as structural "hotspots" where both baseline
exposure and extreme-event risk are elevated. Predictive performance
also varies geographically. Regions with relatively stable pollution
dynamics tend to exhibit higher 𝑅2 values, while areas prone to abrupt
wildfire-driven spikes display lower 5 predictability. This variation
reflects differences in atmospheric transport patterns, urban density,
industrial emissions, and proximity to wildfire pathways. Forecast
accuracy is therefore not solely a modeling issue but also a function of
underlying environmental volatility. From an equity perspective,
proactive forecasting should not be deployed uniformly. Regions with
systematically higher exposure and volatility warrant prioritized
resource allocation. This may include investment in indoor activity
alternatives, portable air filtration where policy permits, and
pre-developed communication templates for rapid dissemination. A
differentiated strategy acknowledges that exposure risk is not evenly
distributed and supports equitable preparedness planning. Seasonal
patterns further reinforce the need for structured planning. Elevated
PM2.5 risk is most frequent during summer wildfire season and certain
winter inversion periods, though regional sea- sonal vulnerability
differs. A risk calendar approach enables education authorities to
intensify monitoring and preparedness during predictable high-risk
windows (e.g., June--September) rather than maintaining continuous
high-alert states. Resource allocation, contingency planning, and
communication strategies can be aligned with seasonal risk cycles to
improve eﬀiciency and respon- siveness. Although the LSTM model is
nonlinear, its behavior aligns with intuitive atmospheric mechanisms.
Low wind speeds and stable atmospheric conditions reduce pollutant
dispersion, allowing partic- ulate matter to accumulate. Shifts in wind
direction can transport wildfire smoke across large distances.
Precipitation reduces airborne particulate concentration through wet
deposition. High temperatures during stagnant summer conditions often
coincide with elevated pollution episodes. Framing these relationships
in accessible physical terms strengthens stakeholder confidence and
supports transparent communication. 7 Operational Value and Responsible
Deployment While statistical accuracy metrics such as MAE and 𝑅2 are
important, the principal value of fore- casting lies in advance notice.
A one-day lead time enables schools to schedule indoor programming,
adjust physical education and recess plans, prepare ventilation
adjustments, and proactively com- municate with families. Sensitive
student populations, including those with asthma or respiratory
conditions, can be notified in advance. Even modest forecast skill can
shift institutional posture from reactive to proactive, reducing both
health risk and operational disruption. The operational benefit of
preparedness may outweigh incremental improvements in RMSE. From a
decision-theoretic perspective, the value of information is asymmetric:
avoiding under-preparedness during high-pollution events carries greater
benefit than marginal improvements on routine days. However, responsible
deployment requires recognition of system boundaries. Forecast
uncertainty increases during abrupt wildfire outbreaks and long-range
smoke transport events that may not be fully captured by local
meteorological inputs. In such cases, predictions should be interpreted
alongside provincial air-quality advisories and other authoritative
sources. We recommend incorporating policy rules that flag days with
elevated predictive uncertainty for manual review. Transparent
communication regarding model limitations enhances institutional trust
and mitigates the risk of overreliance on automated outputs. The system
should be positioned explicitly as decision support rather than as a
replacement for oﬀicial environmental alerts. 6 Overall, the evidence
demonstrates that next-day PM2.5 forecasting is statistically credible,
op- erationally meaningful, and equity-relevant. Sequence-based models
provide measurable improve- ment beyond persistence, particularly during
elevated pollution periods. With responsible imple- mentation and
regionally differentiated deployment, predictive analytics can
materially enhance preparedness, reduce health risks, and promote
equitable resource allocation during air-quality emergencies. 8
Executive Takeaways This analysis shows that next-day PM2.5 forecasting
in Ontario is both statistically credible and operationally actionable.
A sequence-based LSTM model meaningfully outperforms persistence
baselines, demonstrating that predictive signal exists beyond simply
"copying yesterday." The improvement is strongest during elevated
pollution periods, which are precisely the days where proactive action
matters most. Key implications for decision-makers: • Forecasting adds
operational value. A one-day lead time enables proactive scheduling
adjustments, communication with families, and preparation for vulnerable
student popula- tions. • Regional differentiation is essential.
Pollution exposure and predictability vary substan- tially across
regions; deployment should prioritize structurally higher-risk areas. •
Seasonal strategy improves eﬀiciency. Preparedness should intensify
during predictable high-risk windows (e.g., summer wildfire season)
rather than operate in continuous high-alert mode. • Decision support,
not automation. The system should augment oﬀicial advisories and include
safeguards for high-uncertainty days. In summary, implementing a
regionally differentiated next-day alert framework is justified on sta-
tistical, operational, and equity grounds. With responsible governance
and transparent communica- tion, predictive analytics can materially
improve preparedness and reduce health risks in Ontario's education
system. 7 References Brook, Robert D., Sanjay Rajagopalan, C. Arden
